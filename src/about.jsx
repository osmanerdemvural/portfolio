Over the years, I have completed several certifications to stay updated with industry trends, including:

Python & TensorFlow for Data Science
Data Science with R
Capital Market Activities License
Technical Staff Qualification
Skills & Interests
With a strong foundation in technology and analytics, my technical skill set includes Python, Java, C#, SQL, R, and database management. I am also proficient in Linux and Agile Methodologies. Beyond technology, I have deep expertise in portfolio management, financial analysis, and team leadership.

I am passionate about leveraging my skills to develop innovative and sustainable solutions that have a lasting impact. When I am not working or learning, I enjoy exploring new ideas in AI, web development, and data science.
